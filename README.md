## Description

> Challenge #13 ORM E-Commerce Back End

## Introduction 
Our challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Challenges

Since moving the back-end portion of things the biggest challenge has still been getting the larger file tree down, and making sure I'm exporting things correct and requiring them correctly as well.

## Victories

I was actually extremely proud of myself this week. I meet with my tutor towards the end of the week and i try to get everything that i know how to do before asking questions, and with this project I was able to have this more or less completed by the time of meeting with a tutor and only had a question or two. I have found that MySQL gave me such a head ache last week that the Sequelize syntax feels like a breeze and it clicked a lot better this time around.
